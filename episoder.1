.TP
.B \-d \fIDATE\fR

.SH CONFIG FILE
.LP
The configuration file contains default settings for episoder.
.TP
.B agent=foo
Set the user-agent string to be used when fetching data. This is only used for shows on epguides.com.
.TP
.B data=/path/to/file
Path to episoder's data file. If, instead of a file, you supply a database url (as expected by sqlalchemy, eg. 'mysql://localhost/episoder'), episoder is going to use that database for storage instead.
.TP
.B format=unquoted format string
This allows you to customize episoder's output. Available fields are:
.PP
        %airdate     The episode's airdate as YYYY-MM-DD
        %show        Name of the show
        %season      Current season
        %epnum       Episode's number in season
        %eptitle     Title of the episode
        %totalep     Episode's total number
        %prodnum     Production number
.br

If undefined, the default value of
.B %airdate %show %seasonx%epnum
(eg. "2005-07-29 Monk 4x04") is used.
.TP
.B dateformat=unquoted string describing the format
Here you can define the date format you'd like to be used for the output. To get a list of all possible fields, see
.BR date(1).

The default is %a, %b %d, %Y
.TP
.B tvdb_key=KEY
Use your own TVDB API \fIKEY\fR instead of episoder's built-in default key. This is recommended if you use episoder on a larger scale.

See http://thetvdb.com/?tab=apiregister for more details.
.SH CRON
.LP
You might want to have your episode database rebuilt on a regular basis (i.e. daily). The easiest way to achieve this is with a simple cron job:
.PP
    crontab \-l > crontab
    echo "40 5 * * * episoder update" >> crontab
    crontab crontab

.SH FILES
.B ~/.episoder
